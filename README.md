# ShapesColorsNumbers

Shapes Colors Numbers is an edutainment game with the goal of teaching children well... shapes, colors, and numbers!\
I will provide this for free on both iOS and Android for families to be able to entertain and educate their children.

There will be two game modes:
### Lesson Mode
  <p>This mode will introduce a shape for example, a Triangle, and it will spell it out on a transition screen, show the triangle, and an audio clip will play saying "Triangle. A triangle has three sides!" Next, the screen will transition to a blank screen, where a single white triangle will float down. A help text will appear to say "Pop the triangle by tapping it!" That message will fade away, the player will pop the triangle and audio will cue saying "Triangle," and moments later multiple triangles will float down into the play area. </p>
    <p>Once the player has popped all the triangles, the screen will transition to a screen with a square, it will show in text "Square," and an audio clip will play saying "Square. A square has four sides!" And so on. . . This will repeat for all the other shapes. Then, similar introductions will be made for the colors, with the respective color being said each time the colored shape is popped. </p>
    <p>I'm considering a challenge stage at the end of each topic. Say, once the player learns all the shapes, a challenge stage will transition and it will say "Pop all the squares," for example, and all the shapes will float into the screen and the player will only be allowed to pop squares. Once reaching the challenge stage for colors it will compound the lessons, so the challenge will be something like "Pop all blue triangles." This will repeat until counting as well. </p>
    <p>There will be a chapter menu that will allow the player to choose any point of the lesson to revisit. There will be no saves because of that feature. Upon first installing the game, the player will have access to all the chapters for convenience.</p>
   <h3>Sandbox Mode</h3>
  <p>This mode allows the player to choose what shapes and colors the shapes will be, the size of the shapes, and the amount of the shapes. There will be a random button that will randomize these selections for the player just for fun. </p>
  <p>There will be an edgeless mode where the shapes will loop from the other side endlessly. There will be a tilt mode where the player can tilt the tablet or phone and the shapes will slide whichever direction they tilt in. Lastly, the player will be able to select what voice or text will play/show upon popping the shape. </p>
